models:
  - name: internal_raw_production_status
    description: >
      This view contains the production status (live, non_live) of all views
      in the raw database.
    columns:
      - name: table_name
        description: fully qualified name of the table

  - name: internal_landing_zone_columns
    description: >
      This view contains all columns in the landing zone.
      Used for the automated pii classification of newly added columns.

  - name: internal_landing_zone_tables_unclassified
    description: >
      This view returns all tables in landing_zone database
      that contain columns which have not been reviewed
      by the automated pii classification process.

  - name: internal_landing_zone_pii_classifications
    description: >
      This view returns all the latest pii classifications
      for columns in the landing_zone database.

  - name: internal_landing_zone_pii_classifications_ready_for_export
    description: >
      This view returns all the pii classifications and compares them
      with a logging table to determine which classifications have not been
      added to the source system yaml files yet.
      The logging table prevents the process from overwriting manual
      adjustments to the source system yaml files.
      (it will only export the classification result once and if a user
      decides to remove the result because it was incorrect, it will not
      be exported again).

  - name: internal_deleted_ids
    description: >
      This view gathers all ids of entities that are relevant for the 
      anonymization process. It includes all hard (physically removed from the source) 
      and soft deleted (marked as deleted in the data) ids for all entities
      such as users, salesforce contacts, prescreen candidates etc.

  - name: internal_large_pii_tables
    description: >
      This view returns all tables in snapshots and analytics that contain
      a column that was marked with the pii identifier tag. When these 
      columns contain ids from internal_deleted_ids, the respective rows
      are anonymized.

  - name: internal_all_pii_columns
    description: >
      This view returns all columns in snapshots and analytics that were
      marked with the pii_privacy_category tag. These columns are anonymized
      for each row that contains an id from internal_deleted_ids.

  - name: internal_pii_anonymization_log
    description: >
      This incremental model logs each run of the pii anonymization process
      with a timestamp, process type and status. Will be run from pii anonymization
      workflows to log the process start and end.
